# DC32 Gamehacking.gg CTF Writeups

Ahoy hoy! My name is 0xC4DE or just 0X Cade, I was a competitor in the DC32 Game Hacking Community's CTF. This was my first Defcon and I was not sure what to do with myself after walking around to almost every village and just having a look. I find myself bored in most talks, so I found this CTF, and I had a lot of fun. I had gone into this with very minimal game hacking knowledge but a decent background in reverse engineering. I ended up placing 1st in this competition, but it came at the cost of most of my first Defcon (LOL)

The way this competition was structured was in 4 categories:
1. [Unity](Unity/README.md)
2. Pwn Adventure 3 (PwnieIsland) (Not written yet)
3. Synthetik Arena (Advanced Cheat Engine) (Not written yet)
4. Misc/Meta (Not written yet)

Each of these provided their own unique challenges, with Unity being mostly a starting point for beginners, Pwn Adventure 3 being a well documented set of challenges for those who were more intermediate to learn from, and Synthetik as a completely novel set of challenges. The Misc/Meta category consisted of QR codes or flags to find throughout the con, leading to either a small challenge or a flag.
