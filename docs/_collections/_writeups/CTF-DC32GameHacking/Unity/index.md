# Unity Challenges!

These were the beginner-level challenges in a somewhat unique hackable Unity game created by GameHacking.gg.

This category provided ample hints and even a "CTF Guide" which helped players become more familiar with the tools they needed to succeed [Unity CTF Guide (GameHacking.gg)](https://gamehacking.gg/Unity-CTF-Guide-ab23712d46f045b8a7c25ad272234f6d)

Here's a quick list of the challenges, you can read them in any order you want, but they're somewhat sequential:
* [Level 1](Level1)
* [Level 2](Level2)
* [Level 3](Level3)
* [Level 4](Level4)
* [Level 5](Level5)
* [Level 6](Level6)
* [Level 7](Level7)
* [Level 8](Level8)
* [Level 9](Level9)
* [Level 10](Level10)
* [Secret!](Secret!)
