<p>Ahoy hoy! My name is 0xC4DE or just 0X Cade, I was a competitor in the DC32 Game Hacking Communityâ€™s CTF. This was my first Defcon and I was not sure what to do with myself after walking around to almost every village and just having a look. I find myself bored in most talks, so I found this CTF, and I had a lot of fun. I had gone into this with very minimal game hacking knowledge but a decent background in reverse engineering. I ended up placing 1st in this competition, but it came at the cost of most of my first Defcon (LOL)</p>

<p>The way this competition was structured was in 4 categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="Unity/README.md">Unity</a></li>
  <li>Pwn Adventure 3 (PwnieIsland) (Not written yet)</li>
  <li>Synthetik Arena (Advanced Cheat Engine) (Not written yet)</li>
  <li>Misc/Meta (Not written yet)</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these provided their own unique challenges, with Unity being mostly a starting point for beginners, Pwn Adventure 3 being a well documented set of challenges for those who were more intermediate to learn from, and Synthetik as a completely novel set of challenges. The Misc/Meta category consisted of QR codes or flags to find throughout the con, leading to either a small challenge or a flag.</p>
