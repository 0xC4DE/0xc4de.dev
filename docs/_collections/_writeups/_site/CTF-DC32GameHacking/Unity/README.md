# Unity Challenges!

These were the beginner-level challenges in a somewhat unique hackable Unity game created by GameHacking.gg.

This category provided ample hints and even a "CTF Guide" which helped players become more familiar with the tools they needed to succeed [Unity CTF Guide (GameHacking.gg)](https://gamehacking.gg/Unity-CTF-Guide-ab23712d46f045b8a7c25ad272234f6d)
