<h1 id="level-2">Level 2</h1>
<p>Level 2 starts off a lot more barren than level 1. You drop down the pipe and meet what’s going to be our best friend for the rest of this game, the Unicorn floatie!</p>

<p>Immediately I try running into it to see if I can damage it, before remembering, I have a gun!</p>

<p>Well that didn’t work out too well either, but I did find out the unicorn drops the flag, and I cannot cheese him by falling off the stage.

<p>As I see it, I need more ammo. Take note of the bottom right hand corner of the game, there’s a little Ammo icon and count, which means it probably, too can be manipulated using Cheat Engine.

<p>Using this information I use Cheat Engine to search for a 4 byte value at 10, then I shot, then again at 9, then shot and again at 8.</p>

<p>This left me with 3 results. So, which one is the ammo count? Don’t know, I’ll just make all 3 the value 55! This allows me to kill the unicorn with plenty to spare.

<p>Finally, collecting the item gives us the following flag:</p>
